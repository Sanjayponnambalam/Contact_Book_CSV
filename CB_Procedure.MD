# Program Execution is as Follows : 

1. The Program asks for the user input and checks whether the given input is apt or not to the program requisites.
2. It checks for the Choice given by the user using the elif statements.
3. The Program logic is developed inside each if/elif statements using simple python concepts and also by using the CSV modules
4. We import, read and modify the CSV file using the functions available in the module.
5. We use Pandas module to display the data in a well detailed structure of rows and columns (table).
6. After appending/editing/deleting/adding records, we use the break statement to come out of the loop and stop further execution.
